        <p>Creating a home that is very simple and free of excess has been a long journey. When I was younger, I lived with very little because I had little money. In my 30s, I earned more money. I started living a bit excessively. In my 40s, I began to consider needs vs. wants. I started studying minimalism and small-space living. It’s all led to where I am today.
          If you’d like your home to be more peaceful, practicing minimalism is a good place to start. Let’s explore 12 steps to creating a minimalist home. Just as an artist starts a painting with a blank canvas, let’s start with an empty house. Imagine you’re just moving into a new 1000-square-foot home.</p>

      <p>I love an empty house. It’s so full of space and light. When you move into a new home, study the space. Consider what will fit without creating a claustrophobic feel. Know your limitations.I’ve learned so much about interior decorating during this project and I’m definitely gonna share all my newly-acquired wisdom in future posts, but for now, let me give a shout-out to some awesome content creators whose work have helped me tremendously in the last year. If you share my love for minimal interiors, check out the following blogs: these are my main go-to sources for minimalist interior design inspiration.<br><br>I frequently share photos from this blog, as it’s full of beautiful Scandinavian style interiors. It’s curated by Sarah, a Belgian designer living in Munich – she shares snippets from her own home, minimal apartment tours, vintage and modern design objects, and the latest collections of leading Scandinavian brands. She has a great eye for details, and always curates amazing photos.</p>

    <p>Curate & Display is the blog of Tiffany, a freelance interior stylist and self-described aspiring minimalist. Her aesthetic is Nordic style with a muted color palette and a focus on clean lines and simple materials. Besides the inspiring interior shots, she shares home decorating and organizing ideas as well, with lots of useful styling tips. I also loved her series of moving into and redecorating an early Edwardian terraced home, mixing contemporary minimal style with the original features. It was such an interesting process and reassured me that it’s OK to take things slowly.<br> <br> A dark home does not feel open. If the colors in your new home are dark or overly bright, you might want to consider painting. Use light colors: whites and light Earth tones. How many furnishings do you really need? Consider the essentials. Why do you need more than a table and chairs in a dining room? Bedrooms: anything more than a bed, a dresser, and a night stand is too much.</p>
